    <h2>About Polar Bears</h2>
    <p>The polar bear (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) is largely native to the Arctic Circle, comprised of the Arctic Ocean and the surrounding land masses and seas. They are the largest land carnivore currently in existence, rivaled by only the Kodiak bear. Although the sister species to the polar bear is the brown bear, polar bears have adapted to colder climates, with spcefic characteristics for moving across snow, open water, and sea ice, where they spend most of their time hunting down their primary source of food: seals. Due to climate change, its conservation status is currently <strong>Vulnerable</strong>, although population is difficult to estimate due to their remote location and small population densities.<br /><br /> There are many different names for the polar bear, some derived from translastions from the Inuit and Chukchi languages.</p>
